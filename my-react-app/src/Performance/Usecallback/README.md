The React useCallback Hook returns a memoized callback function.

This allows us to isolate resource intensive functions so that they will not automatically run on every render.

The useCallback hook is a hook in React that allows you to memoize a function. It takes two arguments: the first is the function you want to memoize, and the second is an array of dependencies. The hook will return a memoized version of the function that only changes if one of the values in the dependency array changes.

The useCallback Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.

This can improve performance.

By memoizing the function, you can avoid unnecessary re-renders and improve the performance of your React application. The function will only be re-created if one of its dependencies changes, otherwise the same instance of the function will be returned. This can be useful in situations where you have an expensive function that you only want to recompute when its dependencies change.

In our example, we can use the useCallback hook to prevent the function from being recreated unless necessary.

Use the useCallback Hook to prevent the person component from re-rendering needlessly:



USEMEMO HOOK

- The React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value
- The useMemo and useCallback Hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function
- The useMemo hook is a hook in React that allows you to memoize a value. It takes two arguments: the first is a function that returns the value you want to memoize, and the second is an array of dependencies. The hook will return the memoized value that will only change if one of the values in the dependency array changes.
- By memoizing a value, you can avoid unnecessary calculations and improve the performance of your React application. The value will only be recalculated if one of its dependencies changes, otherwise the same instance of the value will be returned. This can be useful in situations where you have an expensive calculation that you only want to recompute when its dependencies change.
